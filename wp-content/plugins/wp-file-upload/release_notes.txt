<!--  --><span><strong>Latest release notes: </strong>This release aims to provide a permanent solution to a problem that appeared six months ago. Some users were getting the warning <span><span style="color:chocolate">"file_get_contents(https://services2.iptanus.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php): failed to open stream: Connection timed out."</span><span> when they were trying to open the <strong>Main</strong> tab of plugin's area in Dashboard. This warning was causing delays opening Main tab, inability to get the latest version of the plugin and some more serious problems in Professional version (e.g. Dropbox feature was not working). After several months of troubleshooting, we found out that the company that hosts Iptanus server is blocking some IP addresses. For this reason we launched an alternative server on <strong>Google Cloud</strong>. This server is identical to the primary one, however it seems that it is not blocking IP addresses. It is also better protected against DDOS attacks and hackers, it is faster and can handle more traffic. To enable this server just activate option <strong>Use Alternative Iptanus Server</strong> from plugin's <strong>Settings</strong>. If after a testing period of 3 months this server works well, then it will become the primary one.</span><!--  --><!--  --><br /><br /><span>
